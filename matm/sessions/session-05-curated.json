  "summary": "Deep within the Cragmaw Cave, the party discovered three chained wolves. While two remained hostile, Semaj's incredible animal handling (nat 20!) tamed the smallest wolf, who would become their most loyal companion. After surviving two flood traps and navigating treacherous passages, they confronted Klarg the bugbear boss. The battle nearly killed Semaj, but the wolf—recognizing Klarg as his tormentor—delivered the killing blow by ripping out the bugbear's throat.",
