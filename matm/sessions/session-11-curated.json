  "summary": "An entire session of combat as the party pushed deep into the Redbrand Hideout. The Nothic fell under relentless assault, bugbears poured out of hallways only to be melted by Semaj's bouncing Chromatic Orb acid, and Kaelia turned Belden into a fire-breathing war machine with Dragon's Breath. By the end, Belden was exhaling cones of flame that vaporized enemies completely—'and by the time the flames finish, there is nothing. Absolutely nothing.'",
