  "summary": "The party rescued Myrna Dendrar and her children from the prison cells, then discovered Glasstaff's wizard workshop. A letter sealed with a black spider revealed Glasstaff's true identity: Iarno Albrek, the Lord's Alliance agent who was supposed to protect Phandalin. A 20-round chase ensued as Glasstaff fled through the hideout, teleporting and casting shields. Kaelia ended it with a Twin-spelled Scorching Ray that punched a hole through his back, igniting him instantly. 'He doesn't even scream. The fire just robs him of his breath before it robs him of his life.' Double dead.",
