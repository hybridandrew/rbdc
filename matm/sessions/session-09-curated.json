Reinforcements poured out of the tavern, but the party fought with fury—Belden's drunken hammer smashing skulls, Kaelia's flames engulfing enemies, Semaj's magic missiles finding their marks, and Larry ripping out throats. Belden went down twice but kept getting back up. Valrex crushed the final Redbrand's skull against a wall. Victory—and Level 3.",
