  "summary": "The party pushed deeper into the Redbrand hideout, discovering Talon—the lost sword of Ser Aldith Trezendar. But the true legend was born when Belden, fighting Redbrands in a cistern, grabbed wet traveler's clothes and used them as an improvised weapon. He strangled one Redbrand, then 'rat-tailed' another—whipping the wet clothes at his throat and slicing it clean open. The session ended in the Tresendar crypts, battling skeleton guardians among ancient sarcophagi.",
