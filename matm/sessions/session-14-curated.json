  "summary": "After a long rest in the Tresendar Manor ruins, the party returned to Phandalin as heroes. The townsfolk whispered: 'Those are the ones that killed the Redbrands.' They met with Sildar Hallwinter, who confirmed the Black Spider's involvement and pointed them toward Cragmaw Castle to rescue Gundren. A return sweep of the hideout revealed Droop—a pathetic goblin prisoner who provided directions to Cragmaw Castle in exchange for his freedom. The party learned of Reidoth the druid in Thundertree and Qelline Alderleaf's farm. A slower session of information gathering and preparation before the next leg of the adventure.",
