  "summary": "After a long rest in Klarg's chamber, the party pushed deeper into the goblin den. They encountered more goblins and two goblin bosses—one of whom grabbed Sildar Hallwinter as a hostage. Belden, recognizing the man who gave them lodging in Neverwinter, challenged the goblin boss Yeemic to an honor duel. What followed was an epic, back-and-forth battle that ended in heartbreak: Belden fell, defeated. The session ended on a cliffhanger with Yeemic wounded but victorious.",
