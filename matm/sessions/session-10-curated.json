  "summary": "A new ally arrived—Aster, an 8-foot-tall Giff druid who smells of ozone and crushed herbs. The party immediately gaslit the recovering Belden into thinking Aster wasn't real, coordinating an elaborate prank that even included Larry. After learning about the Redbrand hideout under Tresendar Manor, they rallied the townsfolk, recruited Darren Edermath, and entered via a secret tunnel. Deep inside, a Nothic's psychic claws scraped at Semaj's mind. The session ended with the aberration casting Rotting Gaze as initiative was rolled.",
